I'm pleased to share my new project: the Academic Research Paper Assistant! ðŸ“š This Streamlit app builds on my earlier Image Summary Generator and dives into academic research support.

My first project called Image Summary Generator used Google's Gemma API to summarize images and answer follow-up questions. The Academic Research Paper Assistant goes further, enabling users to upload PDF research papers and query them with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It uses FAISS for fast, scalable vector search to retrieve relevant paper sections, LangChain to orchestrate the RAG workflow, and PyPDF/Transformers for intelligent PDF processing and text analysis. Answers include citations to the exact paper and section, and the clean, Python-designed UI ensures ease of use for researchers and students.

This project extends my work from image analysis to academic research, leveraging AI for precise, context-aware insights.
